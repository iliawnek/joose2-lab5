Explanation:

Design pattern 1 is the observer design pattern.
The subject is the stock exchange.
The observers are the traders.
When the stock exchange notifies the traders registered to it,
it sends out its trade history to the traders.
From that point, each trader can use the trade history data any way they want,
like using it to calculate average price for example.
